/**
 * The app-open ad (v1.3.0): a short brand splash when the user opens Riplox IG, with the ad
 * shown over it.
 *
 * Google's rules for this format, and where each one is kept:
 *  · *"Integrate app open ads into your splash or loading screens"* and *"should appear before the
 *    user can interact with the app's content"* → the splash covers Home and swallows touches
 *    until the ad is shown or abandoned.
 *  · *"Don't display app open ads on top of other ads (for example, content with banner ads)"* →
 *    Home's banner is taken out of the composition while the splash is up.
 *  · *"should only appear when the user opens or switches back to an app"* → only on a real open
 *    of MainActivity (see [onActivityStarted]); never on the share sheet, never when the share
 *    sheet's "Open app" leads in, never coming back from one of our own screens.
 *  · first ad only *"after your users have used your app a few times"*, the hourly cap, the 60s
 *    floor to other full-screen ads, the ad-free window, the ad-click return → [AdGate.shouldShowAppOpen].
 *
 * The ad is fetched only once an open has passed the gate, and an ad that arrives after the
 * splash has given up is thrown away — by then the user can touch the app, and showing it
 * would be exactly the "surprised by an out of context ad" case Google warns about.
