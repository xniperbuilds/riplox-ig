 * WHAT CHANGED IN v1.1.0 AND WHY: this activity used to be INVISIBLE — it opened, fired a
 * toast and finished. Two consequences, both bad:
 *  · a user who only ever shares from Instagram got no progress, no Cancel and no error. On a
 *    carousel — one link, six videos — a toast saying "Downloading" told them nothing about
 *    what was happening or when it ended;
 *  · and because `Ads.onDownloadComplete` only runs while MainActivity is alive, that user
 *    generated **no ad impressions at all**. A million downloads, zero revenue.
 *
 * AIRLOCK IS NOT WEAKENED BY THIS. The double-door works exactly as before — the link goes on
 * the queue immediately and `awaitStart` still waits for the worker's own FGS lock. A VISIBLE
 * foreground activity is strictly stronger than an invisible one, and the sheet now stays up
 * instead of racing to finish. Back, or a tap outside, dismisses it and the download carries on
 * in the background — the old behaviour, preserved.
 *
 * ⚠️ `android:noHistory` had to come off this activity in the manifest. It finishes an activity
 * the moment it stops being visible, which would have killed the sheet as soon as a full-screen
 * ad or the system share chooser opened over it.
