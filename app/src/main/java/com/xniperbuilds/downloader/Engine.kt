/**
 * The yt-dlp engine: one place that updates it, and one place that remembers what happened.
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS MORE ON INSTAGRAM THAN ANYWHERE ELSE: unlike the TikTok app, Riplox IG has
 * no hand-written extractor to fall back on — **every** download goes through yt-dlp. A stale
 * engine is therefore not a degraded experience here, it is a dead app: the bundled 0.18.1
 * build answers "No video formats found" on a fresh install, which is exactly what the
 * original "download start nahi hoti" complaint turned out to be.
 *
 * The four holes this closes, all of them real:
 *  1. There was no manual update anywhere in the app. Not for a non-technical user, and not
 *     for a technical one either — the only updates were invisible ones.
 *  2. The daily check ran in MainActivity only, so a user who always downloads from the
 *     Instagram share sheet never opened MainActivity and never updated the engine at all.
 *  3. The result was swallowed by `catch {}`. An update that failed every single time looked
 *     exactly like one that succeeded.
 *  4. The worker's self-heal only fired on a fixed list of error strings, so a wording change
 *     on yt-dlp's side silently disabled it.

     * The library decides "already up to date" by comparing its SharedPreferences marker with
     * GitHub's latest tag. It never looks at the yt-dlp on disk. So if the marker is ever
     * written while the files are NOT (an interrupted copy, a restore, a kill mid-update), the
     * app is trapped forever: every check answers ALREADY_UP_TO_DATE and downloads nothing,
     * while the engine underneath stays whatever it was.
     *
     * That is exactly what happened here. The app logged
     * `engine update → ALREADY_LATEST (2026.08.30.232658)` while the engine actually running
     * was the bundled `2025.11.12` — proved by the error text it produced, a string that
     * exists ONLY in the old extractor. On Instagram that is fatal rather than cosmetic: the
     * old extractor has no logged-out code path at all, so every download without a connected
     * account failed, and the daily update that would have fixed it kept answering "nothing to
     * do". The same phone's other app, on a real 2026 engine, downloaded the same links fine.
     *
     * Compared on the date part only: nightly tags carry a time suffix (`2026.08.30.232658`)
     * that a stable build does not, and an exact-match test would force a re-download forever.
